        <article id="post-content"><p>A blog can be about anything. It’s your space, and you control it.</p>
<p>You can share ideas and knowledge, document your progress, connect with an audience if you have one, and, most importantly, reflect on it later. It preserves the timestamp. You can see how the time flies. Most importantly, it will remain somewhere on the internet (at least for a <em>limited</em> time) even after you’re gone from this earth.</p>
<p>Twitter was once known as a microblogging platform, where people got creative within the character limit. It forced users to think carefully about each sentence, which led to some really interesting ideas. Companies, platforms, foundations, and even governments used it as a unique channel for communication and marketing.</p>
<p>But that changed with the billionaire takeover, and Twitter’s unique vibe has been fading ever since. Many people who shared interesting thoughts on Twitter are now looking to move elsewhere. Plenty of platforms have tried to recreate Twitter’s magic, but it’s not easy. So far, Bluesky is the only one I see that has a real chance.</p>
<p>Sure, you can do all of this on any social media platform. But the truth is, any of these platforms could disappear when their time comes. They might let you export your content, but then you’d have to start all over again. This is why most of the big accounts are stuck there. When they go, all they can have is their data in a machine readable format like <code>js</code> or <code>json</code> or <code>csv</code>. Until some platform supports migration with these file exports, you are just stuck.</p>
<p><img src="media/images/blogging.png" alt="A blog can be about anything. It’s your space, and you control it." title="A blog can be about anything. It’s your space, and you control it." /></p>
<p>This is exactly why blogging is the best choice for individuals. Social media can be a channel, but blogging offers real freedom. Blogging can take many forms, and many platforms offer it as a service. But the more I understand the internet, the less I want to depend on any one platform.</p>
<p><em>For eg; take the current WordPress issue.</em></p>
<p>Create a static blog using a Markdown-to-HTML converter and add an RSS feed feature. This way, your content delivery is also managed. Now you are free to move around when you hit a wall. No one is going to gatekeep you.</p>
<p>Important thing to consider is when you take this level of freedom, you also have responsibilities. What to say, what not to say, everything depends on your ability to understand things. Spreading conspiracies and hatred comes with consequences.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I once read a blog post by <a href="https://stephango.com/">Steph Ango</a> where he explains why <a href="https://stephango.com/file-over-app">files over apps</a> make more sense. Since then, that idea has become even more convincing to me. In simple, users should have the control over their data.</p>

<hr />
<p>After starting to build frontends and useful scripts with the help of LLMs, I think everyone should learn to code—at least HTML and CSS. JavaScript and other programming logic can now be generated with the help of LLMs. But if you have the ability to display that logic in a user-friendly way, you can really navigate the future that includes AI in the form of agents, assistants, copilots, or Jarvis.</p></article>
